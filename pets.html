            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

            <p>Maple is a 4 year old domestic shorthair cat. He has grey fur and a pretty pattern. He enjoys lounging while also multitasking to keep watch on the apartment from his favorite laying/perching spots. He enjoys attention, but is less forthright about wanting it. He also enjoys basking in the sun, playing with his favorite stuffed fish, and making guest cameos on various zoom meetings.</p> 
            <p>His favorite ways to be pet are scratches behind his ears, below his chin, and gentle taps on his lower back/butt. He would prefer if you did not pick him up, but will tolerate it on some occasions.</p>

            <p>Kirby is a 4 year old pitbull/boxer mix who belongs to Serena's brother.</p> 
            <p>Kirby barks at me every time he's there when I visit. He isn't ever mad or aggressive though, we think he's just been traumatized (he's a rescue).</p>
