    <p>It was really fun to visit this geyser! I learned that the vent temperature is 192 degrees Farenheit! The short hike to the springs was fun to take with the dogs. </p></div><br>

    <h2>Yellowstone National Parks</h2>
    <div>A beautiful sunset from our most recent trip to Yellowstone National Parks!</div><br>
    <div><img src="images/yellowstone_sunset.jpg" width = "400" alt= "a Golden orange sunset at yellowstone naational park.">
    <p>This sunset was really breathtaking! After a long day hiking, exploring, and sightseeing, we were exhausted when we finally made it back to the car to head back to where we were staying. It was so peaceful to drive and see the pretty skies.</p>

    <h2>Niagra Falls</h2>
    <div>A beautiful sunset with cotton candy clouds above the top of the falls.</div><br>
    <div><img src="images/Niagara_Falls_Sunset.jpg" width = "400" alt= "a sunset with pink skies above the niagra falls.">
    <p>I really love sunsets! After visiting both the Canada side and the New York side, my opinion is that the falls look much prettier from Canada!</p>
